Title: Helper tools to access Amazon S3, compatible with s3tools
Version: 0.3.1
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Mike",
             family = "Ratford",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "michael.ratford@digital.justice.gov.uk"),
      person(given = "Ministry of Justice",
             role = "cph"))
Description: This library is mostly compatible with `s3tools`, which is being 
    retired as we migrate to the new version of the Analytical Platform, so you 
    can replace `s3tools` with `Rs3tools` in your code and you should be good 
    to go. NB `s3tools::accessible_buckets` is not implemented.
